          I have always had an interest in software and web development but
          didnâ€™t think I would be in a place to do it as a career until now. I
          have been studying for a Diploma in Software Development for the last
          year and am looking forward to graduating. In my spare time, the web
          development community is a big part of my life. I am always striving
          to learn more and improve the way I code.
        </p>

          Besides programming I love spending time with friends and family and
          can often be found together going out catching the latest movie,
          staying in playing games on the sofa or planning a trip to someplace
          I've never been before.
